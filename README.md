# Shark Attacks Project: Using Pandas and Regex

## Overview

The goal of this project is to combine data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation with Pandas, besides Regex. The dataset is given by [Shark Attack](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks). 
---

## Goals

My goal is to relate mortality and the kind of damage with shark species to find out which specie has the greatest mortality rate and which one provokes the biggest non-mortal damages. 


As a second goal, I build a temporal series with that info to answer: are sharks becoming more aggressives over time? If true, is related with human activities?

## Files

The files dibuja.py and dibuja2.py are for barplots and time series plots. The file regEX.py and shark.py are for the regular expression cleaning of the species. shark_attack.py and data-wrangling.ipynb are the project notebooks. 


## Conclusion

The conclusions are in the notebook files. Some of them are not clear at all, in particular the relationship with the human activities.
