# Shark Attacks Project: Using Pandas and Regex

## Overview

The goal of this project is to combine data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation with Pandas, besides Regex. The dataset is given by [Shark Attack](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks). 
---

## Goals

 My goal es relacionar la mortalidad y el tipo de daños causados con la especie de tiburon para descubrir, no solo que especie es la que genera mayor tasa de mortalidad, sino tambien que especie provoca mayores daños no mortales.

En una segunda parte intentare construir una serie temporal con esa informacion para tratar de responder una pregunta: ¿los tiburones se estan volviendo mas agresivos con el tiempo?.
De ser cierto, ¿esta relacionado con la actividad humana?

## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo for this chapter.

* **A cleaned CSV data file** containing the results of your data wrangling work.
* **A Jupyter Notebook (data-wrangling.ipynb)** containing all Python code and commands used in the importing, cleaning, manipulation, and exporting of your data set.
* **A ``README.md`` file** containing a detailed explanation of the process followed in the importing, cleaning, manipulation, and exporting of your data as well as your results, obstacles encountered, and lessons learned.

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Examine the data and try to understand what the fields mean** before diving into data cleaning and manipulation methods.
* **Break the project down into different steps** - use the topics covered in the lessons to form a check list, add anything else you can think of that may be wrong with your data set, and then work through the check list.
* **Use the tools in your tool kit** - your knowledge of Python, data structures, Pandas, and data wrangling.
* **Work through the lessons in class** & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your project each night, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
* **Commit early, commit often**, don’t be afraid of doing something incorrectly because you can always roll back to a previous version.
* **Consult documentation and resources provided** to better understand the tools you are using and how to accomplish what you want.

## Useful Resources

* [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)
* [Pandas Tutorials](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html)
* [StackOverflow Pandas Questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas)
* [Awesome Public Data Sets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)
* [Kaggle Data Sets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

## Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you incorporate domain knowledge or unique perspective into your analysis.

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    **Score**|**Expectations**
    -----|-----
    0|Does not meet expectations
    1|Meets expectactions, good job!
    2|Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!

This will be useful as an overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are described in the specs above__, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

## Presentation Guideline and Criteria

### Format

* Presentation Time: 6 minutes
* Q & A: 3 minutes
* **Total Time:** 9 minutes

### Attire

* DRESS TO IMPRESS: [Smart casual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_casual) would be great

### Outputs

* A presentation in [slides.com](https://slides.com/)
* A demo deployed on GitHub Pages
* The presentation and demo will be executed on a class computer (instead of your own)
* Get ready to explain some of your code in GitHub

### Things you might want to talk about

* Short presentation of yourself:
	* Who are you?
	* A hobby you have.
  * __Note: we are getting you ready for final presentation!__
* Elevator pitch:
  * Data set you chose.
  * Why did you chose that data set?
  * The most important thing you learned.
* One technical challenge you faced:
  * Explain the challenge.
  * Explain how and what you did to overcome it.
  * Show and explain code snippets in your presentation slides.
* Git:
  * Display an screenshot of your GitHub graphs to show your commit frequency and how much work you did.
* Pandas Data Wrangling Walkthrough:
  * Walk the audience through the data set you chose, providing an overview of some of the fields and other information contained in the data.
  * Walk the audience through your data wrangling workflow including what initial problems you identified in the data, what cleaning and manipulation techniques you employed, what avenues you decided to pursue and why, and what lessons you learned.
* One important mistake you made:
  * Did you made a mistake planning your time? Maybe transforming a variable that wasn't useful? Accidentally dropping one that was?
