# Shark Attacks Project: Using Pandas and Regex

## Overview

The goal of this project is to combine data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation with Pandas, besides Regex. The dataset is given by [Shark Attack](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks).

## Goals

My goal is to relate mortality and the kind of damage with shark species to find out which specie has the greatest mortality rate and which one provokes the biggest non-mortal damages. 


As a second goal, I build a temporal series with that info to answer: ¿los tiburones se estan volviendo mas agresivos con el tiempo?.
De ser cierto, ¿esta relacionado con la actividad humana?
